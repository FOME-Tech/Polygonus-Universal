# Polygonus-Universal

Basic pinout for the bosch 88 pin plug intended for universal use.  

## NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ANY PNP APPLICATION  

## NOTE - 88pin plug is now hard to source as it seems to be NLA from Aliexpress. 
Hardware tested ok on the first fabrication but is now obsolete due to connector sourcing issues. 
Board is provided as is for reference of if someone wants to fabricate and source their own connectors.
